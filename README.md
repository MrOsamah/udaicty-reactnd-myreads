# Introduction
This is the first project in Udacity's React Nanodegree. In this project, the students are asked to build a react app that fetches a list of books from an API, categorize it in shelves, add the ability to move a book from one shelf to another, and to add new books to the list by searching.

For more details you can see the project rubric [here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/918/view).
